            so far, i've been lucky enough to garner a wide variety of experience, ranging from design projects (thanks ESP!!) to research work to working at a major bank! to see my resume, click <a href = "NancyLi_Resume.pdf" target = "_blank"><b>here</b></a>.

            personal things that were a TOTAL dream come true for me (with hopefully many more to come!) include running my first half marathon (2019), performing at carnegie hall, (2017) and being the headlining soloist for the local symphony!(2016)

            <p>
             i love travelling, and have been lucky enough to have been able to see a ton of AMAZING places on this earth (check out the photography tab for some photos!). so far, i've been to 9/13 canadian provinces and territories, 9/50 states in the USA, and 10 countries (and hopefully will travel to many more in the future!!) from camping in the rockies to performing at a jazz club in havana, travelling has given me numerous memories that i'll treasure for a lifetime.
